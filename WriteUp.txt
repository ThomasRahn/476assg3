This is my Pac Man game.

This game requires two players. The "server" will not be allowed to move until the client has connected to it. The controls are WASD.
The objective of the game is collect as many dots as possible (1 point per dot). The winner will be selected once all the dots have been eaten.

This game uses limited network calls. The Ghosts and pacman use network views to synchronize the positions and the Score is the only thing that is sent across using RPC calls.

Thank you and enjoy,
